## Not a serious Qr-Code Generator

Very inefficient and spaghetti code that works and can generate Qr-Codes
versions 2-5.

Creates a Bitmap-Image as the Qr-Code

## Further Ideas

Optimise the plotting of data to be more readable, aswell as organize
most of the code into a more readable format.

Convert the bitmap to a png file, a fun little future project.
